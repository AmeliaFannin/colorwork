Work in Progress

Knitters use graph paper or excel spreadsheets to design color charts.  Square graph paper cannot reflect an individual's gauge (ratio of stitches to rows), and can result in distorted designs. A design can look surprising squashed or stretched when knitted up.

This app currently creates a custom grid with cells that change color when you click on them. Next steps are to add more color options, color-pickers, add-a-row, add-a-column, and actual size stats.
